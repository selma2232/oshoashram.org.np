              Technology has been connecting everyone from one corner of the
              globe to another in the fastest way. Businesses and organizations
              need a strong digital presence and must adopt technology
              effectively to stay ahead in competition.

              My journey into technology began over a decade ago when I founded
              <strong> PRACAS Infosys</strong> in 2007 A.D. in Biratnagar. I
              aimed to leverage digital solutions to address local challenges
              and foster economic development.
            </p>

            <p>
              My vision has always been to create meaningful impact. I have
              worked with over 500 clients across 15 countries, helping them
              with websites, mobile apps, SEO, social media, corporate emails,
              and IT consulting.

              Good IT practices help businesses grow faster, enhance digital
              presence, optimize workforce, protect data, and safeguard
              reputation against digital threats like hacking, ransomware, or
              identity theft.
