                Pracas Upreti's journey from a startup founder to a
                technology-driven change-maker in Biratnagar, Nepal, exemplifies
                the profound impact that individuals can have when they combine
                innovation with a commitment to social responsibility. Through
                his endeavors, Upreti has not only transformed his community but
                has also set a precedent for how technology can be harnessed to
                drive positive change and create a better future for all.

              <p  className="text-[1em]">
                Upreti's journey into the realm of technology began over a
                decade ago when he founded his first IT startup in 2007 A.D. as
                PRACAS Infosys in Biratnagar. Recognizing the potential of
                technology to bridge gaps and catalyze progress, he embarked on
                a mission to leverage digital solutions to address local
                challenges and foster economic development. His vision was not
                merely to create successful businesses but to effect meaningful
                change in his community.
